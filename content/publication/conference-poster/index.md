abstract: This study seeks to resolve the absence of agreement on identifying housing market bubbles by examining and comparing existing approaches within diverse housing market structures. To this extent, we utilize historical Real Housing Price Indices from the OECD and FED Dallas, along with real estate bubble indicators such as price-to-rent and price-to-income, spanning the period from 1975 to 2022, to assess their universality across different housing markets. Using these data, we empirically verify the results of the widely used IMF method and the GSADF test against historical market behaviors. We prove that commonly used real estate indices such as the Real House Price Index (RHPI) from OECD and the FED Dallas International Housing Database do not accurately represent the entire real estate market situation in some countries. Additionally, the study questions the universality of the IMF (2009) method and the GSADF test, demonstrating inconsistencies in the results based on the specific country and market structure. Specifically, we prove that price-to-rent and price-to-income ratios are not universally reliable indicators of housing bubbles across multiple countries. In countries like Germany and Spain, neither rents nor incomes can be considered fundamental indicators, as the decision to own or rent is influenced by institutional factors external to their levels. Moreover, we document that in countries with significant government support and a common rent-to-own ratio, such as France, the price-to-income ratio is more suitable, as the price-to-rent ratio was found to be overly sensitive. Conversely, in countries with skewed income distribution like the UK or the US, the price-to-rent ratio is more accurate and can detect potential risks up to two years earlier. The findings of the study hold implications for researchers and policymakers, as they emphasize the need for tailored bubble detection methods that consider the institutional factors within each unique housing market. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study evaluates methods for detecting housing market bubbles across diverse countries using data from 1975â€“2022. It reveals that widely used indicators, such as price-to-rent and price-to-income ratios, often fail to account for local market structures and institutional factors. The findings emphasize the need for tailored approaches to identify bubbles, offering critical insights for policymakers and researchers focused on housing market stability.
