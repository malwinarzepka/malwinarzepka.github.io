## Course structure: 
The course is designed to provide students with a foundation in quantitative research methods, focusing on data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Students work in groups to complete two projects: one focusing on the analysis of financial or firm-level data, and the other on designing surveys and analyzing their outcomes. These projects are designed to expose students to diverse analytical techniques and provide opportunities to practice data preparation, statistical modeling, and interpretation. The results of each project are presented to the class, allowing students to practice communicating their findings effectively and receive constructive feedback.

## Key objectives of the course include: 

  - Teaching students to clean, structure, and analyze financial and survey data.
  - Developing an understanding of hypothesis testing, and causal inference.
  - Enhancing students' ability to interpret results and relate findings to theoretical frameworks.
  - Introducing principles of reproducibility and transparency in data analysis.
  - Encouraging collaboration through group-based assignments that simulate research team dynamics.
