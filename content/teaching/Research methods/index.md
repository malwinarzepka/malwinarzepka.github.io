## Course structure: 
The course aims to give students a solid foundation in quantitative research methodologies, with a focus on data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Students work in groups to complete two projects: one evaluating financial or firm-level data, and the other developing surveys and analyzing the results. These projects are intended to introduce students to a variety of analytical tools and allow them to practice data preparation, statistical modeling, and interpretation. Each project's results are presented to the class, giving students the opportunity to practice effectively articulating their findings and receiving constructive feedback.

## Key objectives of the course include: 

  - Teaching students to clean, structure, and analyze financial and survey data.
  - Developing an understanding of hypothesis testing, and causal inference.
  - Enhancing students' ability to interpret results and relate findings to theoretical frameworks.
  - Introducing principles of reproducibility and transparency in data analysis.
  - Encouraging collaboration through group-based assignments that simulate research team dynamics.
