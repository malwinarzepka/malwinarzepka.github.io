## Course structure: 
  I design my courses for both full-time and part-time students, taking into mind their requirements and limits. Full-time students will learn about everything from data queries and programming to table joins and subqueries. Part-time students concentrate on filtering, aggregate functions, and grouping to develop skills that will be useful in their future jobs.
  Each class includes an introduction, examples, and hands-on activities. These individual or small-group assignments allow students to contribute and reinforce their learning. I immediately verify students answers once they complete the exercises. Quick comments to ensure understanding and rectify any problems right away.
