## Course structure: |
  I develop my courses for full-time and part-time students, taking into account their needs and limitations. The course covers everything from data queries and programming to table joins and subqueries for full-time students. Part-time students focus on filtering, aggregate functions, and grouping to gain essential competencies they can use in their careers.
  Each class has an introduction, examples, and hands-on tasks. These individual or small-group tasks enable students contribute and reinforce their learning. After students do the exercises, I check them right away. providing fast comments to confirm understanding and address any errors immediately.
